**Abstract:**   
A Markov model of the cardiac sodium channel is presented. The model is
similar to the CA1 hippocampal neuron sodium channel model developed by Kuo
and Bean (1994. Neuron. 12:819-829) with the following modifications: 1) an
additional open state is added; 2) open-inactivated transitions are made
voltage-dependent; and 3) channel rate constants are exponential functions of
enthalpy, entropy, and voltage and have explicit temperature dependence. Model
parameters are determined using a simulated annealing algorithm to minimize
the error between model responses and various experimental data sets. The
model reproduces a wide range of experimental data including ionic currents,
gating currents, tail currents, steady-state inactivation, recovery from
inactivation, and open time distributions over a temperature range of 10
degrees C to 25 degrees C. The model also predicts measures of single channel
activity such as first latency, probability of a null sweep, and probability
of reopening.
